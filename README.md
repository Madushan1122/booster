Network interface balancer

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/booster-proj/booster?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/booster-proj/booster)

## Abstract
While more and more people today have a fast Internet connection, there are plenty of other people that do not. The aim of this project is to create a solution that combines multiple Internet access points (such as Wifi or mobile devices) into one single faster Internet connection, that it is easy to use, and fast to configure.

## Installation & Usage
#### Binary
Pick your [release](https://github.com/booster-proj/booster/releases).
#### From source
First [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
(Windows is not yet supported)

Afterwards, type this commands into your command line:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/booster-proj/booster.git && cd booster # Clone
make test # Test
make # Build
```

`booster` needs to retrieve the network interfaces that provide a network connection to work. When it starts, it retrieves them (it is also possible to filter the network interfaces by name above the other default filers, using the option `iname`. On macOS I always set it to "en"). Afterwards it spawns a proxy serverusing the protocol specified by the `proto` flag (just use **socks5** for now), which will fetch the data from the sources provided, according to some strategy. At the moment we have only implemented a naive round robin fashion.

#### Run:
``` bash
bin/booster --help
```
For help.
#### Session example:
Setup:
I plug my iPhone 5s (with tethering enabled, iOS 12) into my MacBook Pro (macOS 10.14),
Run:
``` bash
bin/booster -iname=en -proto=socks5
```
Last:
 - System Preferences > Network > Advanced... > Proxies
 - select: `SOCKS Proxy`, type: `localhost : 1080` (or wherever `booster`'s proxy is listening on)
