## Abstract
While more and more people today have a fast Internet connection, there are plenty of other people that do not. The aim of this project is to create a solution that combines multiple Internet access points (such as Wifi or mobile devices) into one single faster Internet connection, that it is easy to use, and fast to configure.

## Installation
*(Windows is not yet supported)*
#### Binary
Pick your [release](https://github.com/booster-proj/booster/releases).
#### Snap
[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/booster)
#### From source
First [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install), then type this commands into your command line:   
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/booster-proj/booster.git && cd booster # Clone
make test # Test
make # Build
```
## Usage
When `booster` spawns, it identifies the network interfaces available in the system that provide an active internet connection. It then starts a proxy server that speaks either **socks5** or **http**. According to some particular **strategy**, the server is able to **distribute** the incoming network traffic across the network interfaces collected.

#### Run:
``` bash
bin/booster --help
```
For help.
#### Session example:
Setup:
I plug my iPhone 5s (with tethering enabled, iOS 12) into my MacBook Pro (macOS 10.14),
Run:
``` bash
bin/booster
```
Last:
 - System Preferences > Network > Advanced... > Proxies
 - select: `SOCKS Proxy`, type: `localhost : 1080` (or wherever `booster`'s proxy is listening on)

## Highscores
This section is reserved for the highest download speed that we managed to obtain in our office. Without `booster` our WIFI's download speed reaches [~34Mbps](https://www.speedtest.net/result/7783615417), but **with booster**... :tada:
